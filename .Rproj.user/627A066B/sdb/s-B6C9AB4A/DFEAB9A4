In this segment we will be attempting, and failing badly, at replicating the results of Levy's \"Relative Strength as a Criterion for Investment Selection\". Thus far, we have attempted to replicate two of the three variables used for the analysis in the paper. In addition, there will be a literature review section where we engage in a lively conversation about similar pieces of work. \r\r\r##4/C Ratio\rThe 4/C Ratio is a performance ratio and is calculated by taking a stocks current weekly price average and dividing it into the stocks price four weeks into the future. \r\r##4/C Graph\r```{r}\rweekly <- x %>% mutate(C4 = avg.price[week+4]/avg.price) \rweekly %>% arrange(week) %>% summarise(avg.week = mean(C4)) %>% \r    ggplot(aes(week, avg.week)) + geom_line()\r```\r\r\r\r##26/C Ratio\rThe 26/C Ratio is another performance ratio and is calculated by taking a stocks current weekly price average and dividing it into the stock price 26 weeks into the future. \r\r##26/C graph\r```{r}\rweekly2 <- x %>% mutate(C26 = avg.price[week+26]/avg.price)\rweekly2 %>% arrange(week) %>% summarise(avg.week = mean(C26)) %>% \r    ggplot(aes(week, avg.week)) + geom_line()\r```\r\r",
